## Architecture and Technologies Used 🏗️

In TeachCall, we adopted a hexagonal architecture and vertical slicing to ensure a modular and scalable design. The PostgreSQL database, along with Spring Boot on the backend, provides a solid and secure foundation. We implemented Spring Security, an email service, and connections with the Whereby API using asynchronous events. On the frontend, we used React for reusable components and React Native for the mobile version, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.

## Project Highlights 🌟

- **Innovation and Creativity**: TeachCall is the confluence of innovative ideas and advanced technical solutions.
- **Focus on User Experience**: We have prioritized an intuitive and accessible interface.
- **Security and Reliability**: Thanks to Spring Security and a well-thought-out architecture, we offer a secure and reliable platform.
